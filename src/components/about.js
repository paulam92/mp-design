      <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Paula. Nice to meet you.</h3>

        <p>
          However, I'm at the beginning of my Web development journey,I'm
          quietly confident, naturally curious, and continuously working on
          improving my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm a student at the Digital Career Institute and following
          graduating I would like to gain my first experiences as a Front-end
          developer and Web designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm interested in freelance and would be happy to work remotely for
          agencies,consult for startups, and collaborate with talented people to
          create digital products for both business and consumer use.
